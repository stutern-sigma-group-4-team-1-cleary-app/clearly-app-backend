To set up the app-core code base, i took the following steps:

Create a folder named "src" where we'll keep all your source code files.

Inside the "src" folder, we created a subfolder named "config". This folder will contain configuration files for different environments.

In the "config" folder, we created the following files: "development.js", "index.js", "production.js", and "staging.js". These files will hold environment-specific configurations for our app.

Additionally, we created a file named ".env". This file is used to store environment variables specific to your application.

In the root of our codebase, we created a file named "app.js". This file will serve as the main entry point of your application.

We have installed the necessary dependencies for your application. In this case, you mentioned that you need the following dependencies: "dotenv", "express", and "mongoose".
